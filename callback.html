    <h1>Callback Function</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>A callback is a function that passed as an argument to another function.</li>
        <li>This technique allows a function to call another function.</li>
        <li>A callback function can run after another function has finished</li>
        <li>There are two ways in which the callback may be called:
            
            <div>
                <ol>
                    <li>Synchronous</li>
                    <div>
                        <p>Synchronous callbacks are called immediately after the invocation of the outer function, with no intervening asynchronous tasks.</p>
                    </div>
                    <li>Asynchronous</li>
                    <div>
                        <p>While, asynchronous callbacks are called at some point later, after an asynchronous operation
                            has completed.</p>
                    </div>
                </ol>
            </div>



    </ul>
